Ossification has previously been observed in LLM literature<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="9">9</sup> in the high data regime but with much smaller models, on the order of O(10M) parameters rather than O(1B). The observation that this phase transition occurs in robotics but with much larger model sizes echoes<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox">Moravec’s Paradox</a>:<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="10">10</sup>what humans find effortless—perception and dexterity—demands far more computational complexity than abstract reasoning. Our experiments suggest that intelligence in the physical world (i.e. physical commonsense) may have a higher activation threshold in terms of compute, and we’re only beginning to explore what lies beyond.<h1 id="scaling-laws-for-robotics" title="Click to navigate to this section">Scaling Laws for Robotics</h1>Scaling laws are commonly measured during pretraining, as shown in Figure 1, which shows the relationship of model size and compute on a downstream zero-shot task during pretraining.  Another type of scaling law relates to the benefits of pretraining that persist into finetuning.`,
